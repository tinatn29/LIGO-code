# QuLIGO-notebooks
We developed a quantum circuit model of a Michelson interferometer to demonstrate the role that quantum mechanics plays in improving precision measurements, using gravitational wave detection at LIGO as an example. 

Based on our preprint (cite), we turned our calculations and code into tutorials (Jupyter notebooks) that can be loaded directly into the IBM Quamtum Experience. Students and quantum physics enthusiasts can use our code, which contains Qiskit scripts, to implement quantum circuits on an IBM quantum computer.
